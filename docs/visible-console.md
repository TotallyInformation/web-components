Creates an on-page output block that shows any `console.xxxx()` output created in JavaScript.

It is mostly useful for debugging on devices where the built-in browser cannot easily show browser developer tools - specifically the developer console. For example, mobile phones.

## Useage

Simply load the library, add a `<visible-console></visible-console>` tag to the page. Everything else is automattic.
