### Possible Additional Components

* `simple-table` - Takes a JSON or JavaScript object or array and displays the contents in a simple table format.
* `data-table` - Similar to `simple-table` but with more options such as nested tables and multiple headers/bodies. Probably also with CRUD controls.
* `data-card` - A data-driven card with headers, footers, etc. Also acts as a container for other HTML as part of a grid view.
* `grid-view` - A controllable grid layout.
* `simple-input` - An input tag with a label. With option to be part of a form (button submission) or to give output on lost focus.
* `labelled-text` - Text output with a label.
* `chart-*` - Various different chart outputs using different libraries
