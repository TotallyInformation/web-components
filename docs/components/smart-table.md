Automatically creates an HTML table layout from input data. The purpose of this component is to make it very easy to produce good quality HTML tables simply based on standard input data, this is normally a complex HTML authoring task.

Data has to be set using JavaScript since HTML attributes do not allow complex data. Optionally can also provide column meta-data to improve the table display.

Rows, columns and cells are all labelled to allow for fine-grained styling and calculations.

The table is created in the light (main page) DOM for easy styling and further manipulation if desired.

## Useage

```html
<smart-table id="st1"></smart-table>
```
```js
const arrObj = [
  {"COL1":"R1C1","COL2":"R1C2","COL3":"R1C3"},
  {"COL1":"R2C1","COL2":"R2C2","COL3":"R2C"},
  {"COL1":"R3C1","COL2":"R3C2","COL3":"R3C3"}
]
const st1 = document.getElementById('st1')
/** We need to wait for everything to be loaded before using components from JavaScript */
addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) => {
    st1.data = arrObj
})
```

## Attributes & Properties

### Attributes

* Attributes specific to this component

  * None.

* Attributes inherited from the `BaseComponent`:

  * `inherit-style` - Load external styles into component. If present but empty, will default to './index.css'. Optionally give a URL to load.
  * `name` - HTML name attribute. Included in output _meta prop.

> [!NOTE]
> A ðŸ’« symbol indicates that the property is dynamic when changed by JavaScript. Technically, this means that the property has a getter and setter function.

### Properties

Each attribute has a corresponding property. You can set the property directly in JavaScript or by using the `setAttribute` method. Note that setting the property will not change the attribute

* Properties specific to this component (that don't have a corresponding attribute):

  * `data` - the data that will be used to create the table.
  
  Can be an array of objects (as shown above), the most common tabular data type. But can also be an object of objects (named rows) or even an array of arrays (unnamed rows and columns).

  * `cols` - an object that specifies meta-data describing the table columns
  
    Each key must match a column id in the data array/object. Each entry can contain the following properties: 
    
    * `id` - the unique column id matching a column key in the data
    * `name` - a column display name
    * `type` - the column type (`string`, `number`, ...)
    * `title` - Optional title string that will be added as a title attribute to the column headings
    
    If not explicitly provided, the cols meta-data will be calculated from the first entry in the data array/object. You can recover the cols data by grabbing a reference to the element and accessing the cols property. This can be used to create customised cols metadata.

    If setting manually, set the `cols` property before the `data` property.

* Properties inherited from the `BaseComponent`:

  * {number} `_iCount` Static. The count of instances of this component that weren't given an id. Creates a unique id as needed.
  * {boolean} `uib` True if UIBUILDER for Node-RED is loaded. (Default=FALSE)
  * {object} `uibuilder` Reference to loaded UIBUILDER for Node-RED client library if loaded (else undefined).
  * {function(string): Element} `$` jQuery-like shadow dom selector (or undefined if shadow dom not used).
  * {function(string): NodeList} `$$`  jQuery-like shadow dom multi-selector (or undefined if shadow dom not used).
  * {boolean} `connected` False until connectedCallback finishes.
  * {string} `name` Placeholder for the optional name attribute.
  * {object} `opts` This components controllable options - get/set using the `config()` method - empty object by default.
  * {string} `baseVersion` Static. The base component version string (date updated).

* Other standard properties:

  * `{string} componentVersion` Static. The component version string (date updated). Also has a getter that returns component and base version strings.

> [!NOTE]
> Static properties have to be accessed via the component's classname. e.g. `CallOut.componentVersion`
>
> If you do not explicitly set an `id` attribute, one will be auto-created in the format `id="xxxx-xxxx-1"`. Where the number is unique on-page. Please note that changing the order of `xxxx-xxxx` elements on the HTML page will change the numbering. It is always best to add your own unique id's.

## Slots

This component uses the light (main-page) DOM, not a shadow dom so slots are not used.

## Styling

### Inheriting Styles

This component uses the light (main-page) DOM, not a shadow dom so styles are inherited from the main document. This means that you can style the component using standard CSS rules and selectors.

### CSS Variables

The following CSS variables are available for styling:

* None.

## Events

The standard events for this library of components are available:

* `smart-table:connected` - When an instance of the component is attached to the DOM. `evt.details` contains the details of the element.
* `smart-table:ready` - Alias for connected. The instance can handle property & attribute changes
* `smart-table:disconnected` - When an instance of the component is removed from the DOM. `evt.details` contains the details of the element.
* `smart-table:attribChanged` - When a watched attribute changes. `evt.details.data` contains the details of the change.

NOTE that event listeners can be attached either to the `document` or to the specific element instance. Use `document.addEventListener` if your web app might be adding new instances of the component dynamically.

All events contain `evt.details.id` and `evt.details.name`. Some events contain `evt.details.data` if indicated.

## Methods

These methods can be used from JavaScript by first getting a reference to the appropriate element instance. As shown in the examples.

### `getCellById` - Get an HTML element reference to a cell using `RxCx` referencing

This returns an HTML element reference so the content of the cell will be a text or HTML string.

You can easily use this to change styling on a specific cell.

```js
const tbl1 = document.getElementById('smart-table-1') // @type {HTMLTableElement}
const cellEl = tbl1.getCellById('R2C3') // @type {HTMLTableCellElement}
if (cellEl) {
  console.log('Reference to cell in row 2, column 3: ', cellEl)
  console.log('The text content of cell R2C3 is: ', cellEl.innerText)
  // At present, this kind of processing is not responsive to data changes
  if ( tbl1.getValueByCellId('R2C3') === 'R2C3' ) {
    cellEl.style.backgroundColor = 'darkgreen' // background-color: 'darkgreen'
  }
} else {
  console.warn('Cell R2C3 not found')
}
```

### `getValueByCellId` - Get the data value of a cell using `RxCx` referencing

This references the actual dataset given to the smart-table instance and so will return the correct data type

```js
const tblEl = document.getElementById('st1') // @type {HTMLTableElement}
const cellValue = tblEl.getValueByCellId('R3C4') // @type {*}
console.log(cellValue, ' <= Value of cell 4th inner property of the 3rd outer property')
```

### Utility

- `getValueByOffset(obj, rowOffset, colOffset)` - Get the data value of a cell in an tabular array/object using row/column numbers
  
  This works both when `obj` is an array or an object.

### Standard methods

`SmartTable.version` will return a string containing both the component version and the base class version.

## Extensions for UIBUILDER for Node-RED
