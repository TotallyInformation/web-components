This is the documentation for TotallyInformation's pure Web Components.

These components do not require any external modules or frameworks. However, they do contain (optional) features to use with node-red-contrib-uibuilder.
They require a reasonably modern, standards compliant browser. No Internet Explorer support (though you may be able to get them to work with a suitable polyfill).

See the examples folder which contains an html and a javascript file for each component that demonstrates their use with and without uibuilder.

See the main README for how to install and use.

## Components

* [`syntax-highlight`](./syntax-highlight) - Show JSON or JavaScript object data as highlighted HTML.
* [`button-send`](button-send) - A simple &lt;button> wrapper that exposes useful data.
* [`html-include`](html-include) - Dynamically include HTML snippets or documents from a web server into your current web page.
