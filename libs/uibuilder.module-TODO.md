# To Do

* [ ] Remove <element>._ui restriction as it prevents setting custom data on web components
* [ ] Allow add/change to use a.b prop names
* [ ] Document `loadScriptSrc` and `loadScriptTxt`
* [ ] Add markdown render function
* [ ] UI
  * [x] Allow simple method of local control from FE - via set msg - enough?
  * [ ] Add prop validation
  * [ ] keep track of added ids?
  * [ ] Handle no ID. Should add a synthetic ID?
  * [ ] Handle script and style types
  * [ ] Change console. to log
  * [ ] Add JSON url load handler
