/**
 * @class
 * @augments TiBaseComponent
 * @description Define a new zero dependency custom web component ECMA module that can be used as an HTML tag
 *
 * @element component-template
 * @memberOf Alpha

 * METHODS FROM BASE: (see TiBaseComponent)
 * STANDARD METHODS:
  * @function attributeChangedCallback Called when an attribute is added, removed, updated or replaced
  * @function connectedCallback Called when the element is added to a document
  * @function constructor Construct the component
  * @function disconnectedCallback Called when the element is removed from a document

 * OTHER METHODS:
  * None

 * CUSTOM EVENTS:
  * "component-template:connected" - When an instance of the component is attached to the DOM. `evt.details` contains the details of the element.
  * "component-template:ready" - Alias for connected. The instance can handle property & attribute changes
  * "component-template:disconnected" - When an instance of the component is removed from the DOM. `evt.details` contains the details of the element.
  * "component-template:attribChanged" - When a watched attribute changes. `evt.details.data` contains the details of the change.
  * NOTE that listeners can be attached either to the `document` or to the specific element instance.

 * Standard watched attributes (common across all my components):
  * @property {string|boolean} inherit-style - Optional. Load external styles into component (only useful if using template). If present but empty, will default to './index.css'. Optionally give a URL to load.
  * @property {string} name - Optional. HTML name attribute. Included in output _meta prop.

 * Other watched attributes:
  * None

 * PROPS FROM BASE: (see TiBaseComponent)
 * OTHER STANDARD PROPS:
  * @property {string} componentVersion Static. The component version string (date updated). Also has a getter that returns component and base version strings.

 * Other props:
  * By default, all attributes are also created as properties

 NB: properties marked with 💫 are dynamic and have getters/setters.

 * @slot Container contents

 * @example
  * <component-template name="myComponent" inherit-style="./myComponent.css"></component-template>

 * See https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer?tab=readme-ov-file#-how-to-document-your-components-using-jsdoc
