            <p>
                These web components from TotallyInformation are stand-alone without external dependencies.
                Each one aims to simplify the use of HTML as a User Interface (UI).
                They work on any page without the need for a framework or other dependencies.
                Where they use 3rd-party libraries, these are integrated so you don't need to worry about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                All you need to do is create a reference to the component's library in your page as shown in the readme and documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of these components require any kind of front-end framework, however some have enhancements to work better
