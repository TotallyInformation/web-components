* Lots of ESLINT fixes.
* Tidy up and rationalise the docs home page, roadmap and ideas pages.
* Start to document the standard Node-RED/UIBUILDER to browser remote-control integration.

## v1.1.0

Initial release. First release [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@totallyinformation/web-components).

This is the first proper release of these web components. They have now matured sufficiently to be worth publishing.

  Circular thermometer display and controller for heating systems. Based on @ghostmaster75's Node-RED Dashboard Widget of the same name: https://flows.nodered.org/flow/9ca3a19e0e2ff606bd64f1e73a2191eb

* New test component - simple-switch.
