A repository of simple W3C Web Components. These may have extra capabilities for use with UIBUILDER for Node-RED but all work independently as well.

Additional documentation is available in the docs folder which is also exposed as a website at https://wc.totallyinformation.net/.

### Demos & Documentation

To see the web components in action, go to [`https://wc.totallyinformation.net`](https://wc.totallyinformation.net).

Documentation is available on the same website. You can also view the documentation in the `docs/` folder of this repository.

Alternatively, there is a built-in Node.js mini web server. Running the npm script `npm run tests` will start the server on port `8788`. Opening `http://127.0.0.1:8788` in your browser will give a list of all available demos and links to documentation and source code. Note that the mini-server has to download the Cloudflare `wrangler` server, you will be asked if you wish to continue.
